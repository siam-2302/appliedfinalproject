    Here you can select from a variety of ciphers:
    - [XOR Cipher]: It is used with a key when encrypting and decrypting a series of plaintext bytes.
    - [Caesar Cipher]: Simple encryption method wherer each letter in the plaintext is shifter a certain number  of places down the alphabet.
    - [Primitive Root]: A mathematical concept used in certain cryptographic algorithms.
    - [Block Cipher]: A symmetric key cryptographic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits, called blocks.
